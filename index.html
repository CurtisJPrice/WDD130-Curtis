            Hello, I am Curtis J. Price from Eagle Creek Oregon, USA. I am 27 years old and currently volunteering at a residency park my family manages for three years now. 
            I have yet to serve a mission, but do volunteer at my local temple in the laundry wing, and I will never forget all of the spiritual and fun experiences I have at present, as it's one of
            the defining moments of my life for the past few years. My current hobbies are binge watching shows on Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, building robot model kits and a few other technology hobbies like animation or 3d designing. 
            I took up this course because I want to increase my knowledge and skills in software development, which will allow me to find a better job in the future. 
            I already have previous background with the use of programs like adobe photoshop for a technical elective subject during my high school years, but that was way back over 8 years ago, and would like to experience more technical courses to both benefit and touch up my overall skill set and potential requirements. 
            I am looking forward to meet you all and to share my knowledge and skills for this course!
